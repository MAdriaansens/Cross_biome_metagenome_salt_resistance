Kia ora,

Data from Inskeep et al.2022 from the Yellow Stone National Park Metagenome project are manually downloaded from IMG JGI. 
Data from Ramos-Barbero et al.2021 is also manually downloaded.

Both are put in seperate directories of other SRA downloads in directory SRA.
These are then subdivided in paired end and single read sequence runs. A majority is paired end.

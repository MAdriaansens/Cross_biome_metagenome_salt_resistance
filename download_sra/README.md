Kia ora,

Data from Inskeep et al.2022 from the Yellow Stone National Park Metagenome project are manually downloaded from IMG JGI. 
Data from Ramos-Barbero et al.2021 is also manually downloaded.

Both are put in seperate directories with the name of their studies first author.
Other SRA downloads in directory SRA, these are then subdivided in paired end and single read sequence runs. 
(A majority is paired end.)

From this cutadapt/4.4 will be ran for single and paired end reads (without adapter or qc specifications).
